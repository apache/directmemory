DirectMemory Simple Usage


  Add a dependency to the DirectMemory cache artifact:

+------------------------
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.directmemory.server</groupId>
    <artifactId>directmemory-cache</artifactId>
    <version>${currentRelease}</version>
  </dependency>
+------------------------

  Create your {{{./apidocs/reference/org/apache/directmemory/cache/CacheService.html}CacheService}} instance:

+------------------------
  CacheService<Object, Object> cacheService = new DirectMemory<Object, Object>()
    .setNumberOfBuffers( 10 )
    .setSize( 1000 )
    .setInitialCapacity( 100000 )
    .setConcurrencyLevel( 4 )
    .newCacheService();
+------------------------

  Use the cache service to store object, Those methods returns a {{{./apidocs/reference/org/apache/directmemory/memory/Pointer.html}Pointer}} if this pointer is null your object has been stored:

+------------------------
  put( K key, V value )
  put( K key, V value, int expiresIn )
+------------------------

  Retrieve an Object from the cache service:

+------------------------
  V retrieve( K key );
+------------------------
