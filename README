Apache DirectMemory is a multi layered cache implementation featuring off-heap memory storage (a-la BigMemory)
to enable caching of java objects without degrading jvm performance.
Its main purpose is to act as a second level cache (after a heap based one)
to collect large amounts of data without filling up the java heap and thus avoiding long garbage collection cycles.
Included in the box is a small set of utility classes to easily handle off-heap memory buffers.
